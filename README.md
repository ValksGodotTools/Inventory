## A Game Inventory being made in Godot 4 C#
The goal of this project is to attempt to perfect a game inventory system so it can be used across all games that make use of inventories.

As of writing this, this project requires Godot 4 Release Candidate 1 (`v4.0.rc1.mono.official [8843d9ad3]`). If you are unsure which version this project is on, please check the `Inventory.csproj` file, the version will be displayed in there.

### Features
- [x] Inventories of varying sizes can be defined
- [x] Inventory slot size can be customized
- [x] Player Inventory Hotbar
- [x] Smooth player inventory open / close animations

### Implemented Controls
- [x] `Left Click` to pick up / place item stack
- [x] `Hold + Left Click` to continuously pick up items of the same type
- [x] `Shift + Left Click` to transfer item stack from inventories A to B
- [x] `Hold + Shift + Left Click` to continuously transfer item stack from inventories A to B
- [x] `Shift + Right Click` to split stack
- [x] `Right Click` to pick up / place single item
- [x] `Hold + Right Click` to continuously place a single item
- [x] `Double Click` to pick up all items of the same type
- [x] `Shift + R` to sort items in all open inventories by descending item count
- [x] `Shift + T` to take all items from the 'other inventory' and put them in the players inventory
- [x] `1` `2` `3` `4` `5` `6` `7` `8` `9` to move / swap items to player hotbar slots
- [x] `I` to open the players inventory
- [x] `E` to interact with objects in the world

### Todo
- Hotkey to deposit all items from player inventory to 'other inventory'
- Make item panel description popup only appear after small delay
- Saving / loading inventory data
- Allow items to define their own max stack sizes
- Q = Drop Item (x1)
- Ctrl + Q = Drop Stack
- Maybe implementing ENet-CSharp and syncing all of this inventory stuff over the network. (There would be a demo where 2 players would see each other walking around and see the inventory update when the other player interacts with it)
- Giving items a category property so the sorting hotkey can sort by category or any other item property for that matter
- Add item rarities (maybe rare items have a glowing outline achieved used Godot Shaders)

### Example Code
```cs
private Inventory ChestInv { get; set; }
private Inventory PlayerInv { get; set; }

public override void _Ready()
{
    ChestInv = new Inventory(this);
    ChestInv.SetAnchor(Control.LayoutPreset.CenterTop);

    for (int i = 0; i < 9; i++)
        ChestInv.SetItem(i, new Item(Items.Coin));

    ChestInv.SetItem(0, 2, new Item(Items.Coin, 3));
    ChestInv.SetItem(1, 2, new Item(Items.CoinSnowy));

    PlayerInv = new Inventory(this);
    PlayerInv.SetAnchor(Control.LayoutPreset.CenterBottom);

    for (int i = 18; i < 27; i++)
        PlayerInv.SetItem(i, new Item(Items.CoinPink));

    Inventory.PlayerInventory = PlayerInv;
    Inventory.OtherInventory = ChestInv;
}
```

### Contributing
Please talk to me over Discord `va#9904` before you do anything. 

Have a look at the [todo list](#todo) and the [projects issues](https://github.com/Valks-Games/Inventory/issues) for things to do. On top of all that, I'm always trying to find ways to clean up the code and make it more humanly readable.
